## Wedding Management
**INTRODUCTION:**  project “Wedding Management”.<br>
### `Reasons for this project:`
Since most of the wedding receptions nowadays have not applied any special programs for managing weddings, and some of the other related tasks such as ordering the event,  payment, staff management, the foodservice, and the banquet halls. The medium and small size of wedding reception service would perform as follows:
* The receptionists are still mainly using pens and papers to take notes; and with the higher wedding reception services, they use information technology devices such as phones, tablets, laptops too. So there is still no specific program yet.
* The menu is mostly used by paper which is difficult to change. 
* The form of payment is mainly used handwritten receipt which is charged by the handheld calculators. 
 * The organization and management of employees, hours, work shifts, income statements, and monthly revenue summary, still use the very basic things such as Excel. <br>

**`Conclusion`**: Because of these inconvenient and ambiguous surveys from our relatives and friends who have registered wedding reception services before, we have designed a special website for this service to both of the employees and managers that they can easily organize, manage, and improve service quality. At the same time, this site will provide better employee management. Also, employee can preside over the plans for the wedding reception through the website, so it should be less confusing and mistaken.

### `Advantages:`
* Using this web application instead of common desktop applications (WinForms) could make it compatible with different operating systems and computers. Ex: WinForms is not available for macOS, …
* The purpose of this UI, UX software is designed for management. Therefore, the easy-to-use criterion and the clear arrangement will be the primary objective. The functions and buttons are placed in an appropriate position for better visibility, which won’t cause confusion and difficulty while using the website either. The dominant colors for this website are fresh and bright, which helps employees and managers feel satisfied and comfortable while using the web application.
